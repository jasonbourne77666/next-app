[00:01.21]viva la vida - Coldplay

[00:13.81]

[00:13.81]I used to rule the world

[00:17.45]大千世界曾由我主宰

[00:17.45]Seas would rise when I gave the word

[00:20.41]巨浪也曾因我之命澎湃

[00:20.41]Now in the morning I sweep alone

[00:24.28]而今我却在黎明独自入眠 

[00:24.28]Sweep the streets I used to own

[00:41.63]在曾属于我的大道落寞徘徊

[00:41.63]I used to roll the dice

[00:45.21]凡人生死曾由我主宰

[00:45.21]Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes

[00:48.55]尽情品味惊恐在死敌瞳孔绽开

[00:48.55]Listen as the crowd would sing:

[00:52.17]欣然倾听百姓高歌喝彩：

[00:52.17]Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!

[00:55.59]先王亡矣！新王万代！

[00:55.59]One minute I held the key

[00:59.15]此刻我手握权位经脉

[00:59.15]Next the walls were closed on me

[01:02.12]转瞬才知宫墙深似海

[01:02.12]And I discovered that my castles stand

[01:06.19]恍然发现我的城池

[01:06.19]Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand

[01:10.15]基底散如盐沙乱似尘埃

[01:10.15]I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

[01:13.85]听那耶路撒冷钟声传来

[01:13.85]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

[01:17.13]罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海

[01:17.13]Be my mirror my sword and shield

[01:20.27]担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌

[01:20.27]My missionaries in a foreign field

[01:23.91]我的传教士屹立边疆之外

[01:23.91]For some reason I can't explain

[01:27.77]只因一些缘由我无法释怀

[01:27.77]Once you go there was never, never an honest word

[01:34.20]一旦你离开这里便不再，不再有逆耳忠言存在

[01:34.20]That was when I ruled the world

[01:50.82]而这便是我统治的时代

[01:50.82]It was the wicked and wild wind

[01:54.87]凛冽邪风呼啸袭来

[01:54.87]Blew down the doors to let me in.

[01:57.83]吹散重门使我深陷阴霾

[01:57.83]Shattered windows and the sound of drums

[02:01.96]断壁残垣礼崩乐坏

[02:01.96]People couldn't believe what I'd become

[02:05.36]世人不敢相信我已当年不再

[02:05.36]Revolutionaries wait

[02:08.90]起义大军翘首期待

[02:08.90]For my head on a silver plate

[02:11.73]有朝一日我站上断头台 

[02:11.73]Just a puppet on a lonely string

[02:16.00]恰如傀儡随吊线寂寞摇摆

[02:16.00]Oh who would ever want to be king?

[02:19.73]悲哉，谁又曾渴望万人膜拜？

[02:19.73]I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

[02:23.39]听那耶路撒冷钟声传来

[02:23.39]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

[02:26.67]罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海

[02:26.67]Be my mirror my sword and shield

[02:30.66]担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌

[02:30.66]My missionaries in a foreign field

[02:33.50]我的传教士屹立边疆之外

[02:33.50]For some reason I can't explain

[02:37.05]只因一些缘由我无法释怀

[02:37.05]I know Saint Peter won't call my name

[02:40.31]我亦知天堂之门不会为我敞开 

[02:40.31]Never an honest word

[02:43.59]不再有逆耳忠言存在

[02:43.59]But that was when I ruled the world

[03:15.82]但这却是我统治的时代

[03:15.82]I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing

[03:18.99]听那耶路撒冷钟声传来

[03:18.99]Roman Cavalry choirs are singing

[03:22.29]罗马骑兵歌声震彻山海

[03:22.29]Be my mirror my sword and shield

[03:25.90]担当我的明镜，利剑和盾牌

[03:25.90]My missionaries in a foreign field

[03:29.40]我的传教士屹立边疆之外

[03:29.40]For some reason I can't explain

[03:32.94]只因一些缘由我无法释怀 

[03:32.94]I know Saint Peter won't call my name

[03:35.97]我亦知天堂之门不会为我敞开 

[03:35.97]Never an honest word

[03:39.25]不再有逆耳忠言存在

[03:39.25]But that was when I ruled the world

[03:42.64]但这却是我统治的时代

[03:42.64]
